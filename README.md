# cactus

**water your friendships.**

## what is this?

Cactus will keep your friend group connected.

Create a group. Invite your friends. Set an update cadence. Earn points. Have fun.

## who is this for?

Long distance friendships and families, forgetful people, bad texters, the gc, the exclusive four-person gc, the ultra-exclusive three-person gc that that one person isn't in, coffee lovers, beli fanatics, dog owners, meme aficionados, the chill coworkers from your start class, gym buddies, the pilates and matcha crew, letterboxd demons, the ppl that wait 5hrs on the west side highway for a tennis court, the school group project, your jiujitsu open-mat enemies, the d&d party that always reschedules, Nathan Ang, etc.

If there are humans you care about, this is for you.

## how does it work?

### groups

You and your friends will create a **group**. You may be part of as many **groups** as you'd like, with as many different people as you like.

Careful not to spread yourself too thin! More **groups** means more **updates** to share.

### updates

Each **group** will have a cadence that **updates** are expected (e.g. daily, weekly, etc). Group members are expected to share at least one **update** within that cadence.

An **update** can be literally anything. It could be a five-page tirade on tipping culture. It could be "back hurts from lifting, took tylenol." It could be "smh."

Failure to post an **update** in a timely manner will result in you paying the **stake**.

### points

Each **group** will have a **points** total, which will grow over time. You and your people will earn points simply by interacting with each other (i.e. posting updates regularly, adding comments, reacting, etc).

As your group earn more points, you unlock rewards.

### rewards

Rewards are given out to groups that accumulate a certain number of points. These rewards can include exclusive emoji reaction packs, custom app themes, typefaces, increased photo/video sharing limits, and even physical merch customised for your group.

## why a cactus?

Cacti are able to go long stretches without water. They are sturdy, resilient to the elements, and long lasting. You can count on them living on year after year.

However, cacti will *eventually* die without water. Every so often, they need attention. They're low-maintenance, not no-maintenance. You probably see the parallels here...

More importantly, they're bulbous and cutely shaped.
